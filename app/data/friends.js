  "bio":"[Seasons 1-8 (all)]<br />You must be organized, resourceful, and calculated to have landed our beloved protagonist as your new bestie. It can be safely assumed that you have a wickedly dry sense of humor to have an appreciation for someone with a persistent inner monologue with their 'Dark Passenger'. Perhaps you could share insights with your highly intelligent and introspective pal over a coffee on Miami's Calle Ocho or a torta cubano in Domino Park. Like your new friend, you've got to enjoy a challenge, and although you both are fully aware of your human defects, you are masters of compartmentalization and can effectively redirect your nefarious powers for good!"

  "bio":"[Seasons 1-8 (all)]<br />Don't let the tough persona fool you - Dexter's potty-mouthed foster sister comes up in the spoon as your new homie as you both share an undefatigable sense of loyalty to those you care about. Along with her crass and impulsive personality, Deb will definitely make you feel like you're hanging with one of the guys although it won't be long before you'll see how much she definitely wears her emotions on her sleeve. You can gain some ground by making note of Deb's frustration at Dexter for not opening up more emotionally. As she has undying loyalty to her brother - who knows - she might even kill for you, too!"

  "bio":"[Season 1]<br />You're obviously detail-oriented and likely drawn to all things science-related for 'Biney' to draw your match. Dexter's long-lost biological brother can be a bro to you, too, and you should solidify that bond over a nice batido or other frozen drink, since's he's gained notoriety as Miami's one and only 'Ice Truck Killer'. Be sympathetic with Brian as he carries on about his romance with Deb and his elaborate scheme to re-connect with Dexter. If not, you could find yourself without a leg to stand on in the end."

  "bio":"[Season 2]<br />An artistic streak must be what brings you to pair with this obsessive sociopathic painter with an insatiable appetite for setting things on fire. If the local bohemian coffeehouse is not in the stars for a meetup, you might instead consider breaking (or burning) bread at the neighborhood Benihana. A word to the wise - don't let this seductress get too attached as she will destroy anything that stands in the way of satisfying her burning desire."

  "bio":"[Season 3]<br />There's something about risking it all that matched you with an amigo such as this. Your assistant district attorney chum is guaranteed to provide countless hours of intelligent conversation over cafecitos or cortados, and once under your spell, he's bound to insist on accompanying you on your next adrenaline-pumping adventure. Keep an eye on your new barrister bud, however, lest he finds you in contempt and that underlying manipulative streak of his gets focused against you when you least expect it."

  "bio":"<p>[Season 4]<br />There's bound to be a little tension in the air when you hang out with this chosen companion, but don't take it personally as you both share a tendency to simmer and stew about past slights. With the Trinity Killer as a new friend, commiserating about those injustices could strengthen your bond if you make those dates over a cup of soothing chamomile at a quaint teahouse. Unless you want your new-found relationship to drain you of every drop of your being, though, you might want to especially avoid bathtubs around this bloke.</p>"

  "bio":"[Season 5]<br />Your new pal is outgoing like you by virtue of being a renowned author and motivational speaker. Although he might deny it over a robust Sumatra or a hoppy IPA, he's also the leader of the Barrel Girl Gang; a group of his less-savory friends who are a rogue's gallery of sadists responsible for abducting and committing unspeakable acts of violence to several women before ultimately killing them and stuffing their remains into large barrels. Despite this comrade's charm, it's best to make other plans if he invites you on a tour of his childhood summer camp, though."

  "bio":"[Season 6]<br />Something about your spiritual nature pairs you with the Doomsday Killer. Maybe it's biblical prowess or a keen interest in ancient ritual that brings you two together, but whatever that revelation is in the end, rest assured both of you can surely sacrifice a dark and stormy evening or two scripting plans to hang out in communion over a nice chalice of sacramental wine somewhere."

  "bio":"[Season 7]<br />You will find yourself intrigued with your intoxicatingly toxic florist BFF; wanting to spend lots of quality time together possibly reminiscing about youthful indiscretions. Both of you are exceedingly patient and cunning and can look forward to swapping tales of weaving your own webs to get what you want. Steer clear of libations even as seemingly benign as a lovely cup of herbal tea though, as this new pal with a green thumb and a checkered past has a bad habit of poisoning those who fall out of favor with her."

  "bio":"[Season 8]<br />An urge to get even is the thread you have in common with your new 'Brain Surgeon' of a companion. If you have half a mind to meet up by the pool for a few brewskis (and maybe listen to some Mama Cass), you will be wise to let him carry on about all of his mommy issues. Anyone with any gray matter left upstairs will be able to tell right away that this is the way to win this potential buddy's loyalty."
